PLEASE NOTE: 

This is Beta test code for the ANAN-10E and 100B using Protocol 2.
Whilst this has been through a limited Alpha test phase successfully,
given the large number of options and features, to date it has not been subjected to rigorous  testing.

Ethernet runs at a Gigabit.  Due to the fact that the FPGA is 99% full a number of features are not supported:

1. DHCP is not supported, in which case you need to use a fixed IP address.
2. ICMP (ping) is not supported.
3. You must use the Bootloader to load new FPGA code.
