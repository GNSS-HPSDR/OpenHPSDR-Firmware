Orion MkII release notes

7 Dec 2016	- Constrained the new CTRL_TRSW output in Orion.sdc to close timing

2017 	 Jan 30	- port of Orion_MkII_v1.0 (Quartus II v13.1) to Quaruts Prime Lite v16.0
		- regenerated all megafunctions using v16.0 megafunctions
		- modified automatic-mode switch points in HPF_select.v and BPF2_select.v to:
			...
			if (frequency <  1500000) 	HPF <= 7'b0100000;   	// bypass
			else if	(frequency <  2100000) 	HPF <= 7'b0010000;	// RX BPF1 160M	
			else if (frequency <  5500000)	HPF <= 7'b0001000;	// RX BPF2 80M/60M
			else if (frequency < 11000000)	HPF <= 7'b0000100;	// RX BPF3 40/30M
			else if (frequency < 22000000)	HPF <= 7'b0000001;	// RX BPF4 20M/17M
			else if (frequency < 35000000) 	HPF <= 7'b0000010; 	// RX BPF5 15/12M
			else 				HPF <= 7'b1000000;	// LNA, active above 35MHz
			...
		- removed C10_PLL
		- changed C122_PLL/.c0 output to 10.000MHz
		- changed 122.88 MHz module lock XOR feedback to operate at 10MHz vs 80KHz
		- added C122_PLL_SHIFT to obtain a phase shifted 122.88MHz clock for DACD (TxDAC) generation
		- replaced ASMI constraints in Angelia.sdc using the v16.0 AMSI path versions to constrain 
			the new I/O ports/paths
		- set the PLL_IF outputs to:
			PLL_IF/.c0 = 48 MHz
			PLL_IF/.c1 = 12.288 MHz
			PLL_IF/.c2 = 3.072 MHz 90 deg phase shift
			PLL_IF/.c3 = 48 KHz
		- set C122_SHIFT_PLL/.c0 = 122.88 MHz with 15 deg phase shift
		- removed all max/min delay timing constraints in Angelia.sdc, compiled
		- closed timing, re-compiled
		- removed clean_PTT_in as an input to FPGA_PTT to prevent PTT timing problems with software
		- changed Alex SPI.v to send ALex data once for each time the Alex data word changes
		- changed version number to v1.1
		- removed all max/min delay timing constraints in Angelia.sdc, compiled
		- closed timing
			
	Feb 22	- port to Quartus Prime Lite v16.1
		- upgraded all megafunctions to v16.1 megafunctions
		- changed ADC0 attenuator assignment logic to fix PureSignal auto-attenuate bug
		- removed ADC3 daughterboard references/outputs
		- changed version number to v1.2
		- retimed, compiled iteratively until timing closed

	Mar 14	- fixed XVTR mode bug as follows:
			- assigned TXRX_STATUS to FPGA_PTT and to bit 34 of the 48-bit Alex SPI data word
			- assigned CTRL_TRSW to depend on both FPGA_PTT and C&C C2[1] bit (XVTR_Enable) when C0=0010_010x is set
		- changed FW version number to v1.3
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed

	Mar 17	- modified SPI.v to send the Alex SPI data word twice each time the data word changes
		- changed FW version number to v1.4
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed

	Mar 23	- changed user digital IO connections as follows:
			IO5 = TX INHIBIT, pin 16 of J16, rear 8000DLE panel DIG IN 1
			IO8 = External CW Key, pin 13 of J16, 8000DLE rear panel DIG IN 2
		- changed iambic.v to set IO8 as ext CW key input
		- added debounce to IO5 and IO8
		- changed C122_SHIFT/.c0 phase angle to 11.25 degrees
		- changed output_delay for DACD[*] paths to 1.2 nSec in Orion.sdc
		- changed FW version number to v1.1
		- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
		- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed
